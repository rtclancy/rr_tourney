Proposed 2023 Sandbaggers Round Robin Invitational
---------------------------------------------------

In the interest of good fun, trash talk, and competitive play I'd like to propose the following for the upcoming season. Let me know if there is any interest.

Notes:

I know there may be different opinions about Mulligans and breakfast balls for these matches but I didn't want to interfere with another concurrent match that may be going, on for example between carts over 18 holes. These are match play events so if you and your opponent want to alter the rules before your match feel free to do so.

Rules:
1) Must have established a handicap using 2 or more 18 holes scores prior to first match (does not have to be new scores just at least 2 most recent).
2) Each player will play every other player once during season in a 9 hole handicapped match play format (this allows u to knock off 2 matches in one 18 hole round)

3) scoring

2 points awarded for winning a match
1 point awarded to each player for a tie
-1 points awarded to to each player for non-completed matches at end of season

4) max score = triple bogey,with the exception that if you happen to be giving a compeititor 2 strokes on a hole his max is quad bogey
5) Breakfast ball: if it's your first hole of the day feel free to take a breakfast ball (if hit breakfast ball must be played for remainder of hole)
6) Mulligans: 1 per match NOT USABLE ON PAR 3s
6a) provisional Mully: (Belden likes these), if you "CALL" (emphasis added) and play a provisional Mulligan you can play either ball but your Mulligan is no longer available for the remainder of the match 
7) Gimmies: Hopefully everyone is playing to win so if you think he can't make it make him put it, this is solely at the discretion of the players competeing.

8) season runs from 5/1 to 12/1 2023
9) entry fee $10
10) payout

1st place - 70% of pool
2nd place - 20% of pool
3rd place - 10% of pool
