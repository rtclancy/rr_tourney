    There was no breeze and heat and humidity were high at Fenwick on Wednesday but Braverman was undeterred, scoring a 37 for the 9 and defeating Belden 3 and 2. Braverman also won the sidebar putting contest, sinking multiple putts including a birdie putt from off the green on 9th hole, with Lillquist also putting well to take 2nd place.

    Weekend High and Lowlights:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "Triple B" and "Steve Oh, Oh, Oh it went in" posted some great scores on Saturday at Quarry both finishing with rounds of 84. Steve was unhappy with his putter on around the 13th and he took it aside for a scolding. It stiffened to the challenge and he sunk 3 or 4 lengthy putts on the way in, capping it off with a 35 footer from the collar on the 18th.  Triple B posted 4 birdies in his round but the heat proved too much on 17 and 18 and he was only able to tie Le Frenchman.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile Sandbagger Bob was off his game all day: late to show, as he had the tee times wrong, and then left his phone at the bar making his trip home a half hour longer. Only good thing is he posted another shitty score and his index is now up to 20.5.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sunday saw Williard Fairweather also post 4 birdies and a round of 75 at Royal. Pretty good for a 10 handicapper.
    <br>
    <br>
    On a sad note, there is a rumor circulating that D-Day Kenny may be abandoning the game and taking up knitting (or was it Tennis). What a pussy! C'mon Man!

    7/02/2023 - Parting of the Clouds, Hunter/Meriden
    <br>
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br>
    Today's High and Lowlights:
    <br>
    <br>
    Weather Channel radar proved accurate today as the clouds parted just prior to the Sandbaggers' tee off; well planned by the prophetic Triple B.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the back side Deano v. JB match, Deano drained a 35 footer on the par 4 12th. JB retailated on the 13th by guiding his golf cart over Deano's coveted Sharkey putter earning JB the "Douche of the Day" award, his 11th time to win this. Congrats JB! Deano undeterred picked up his slightly altered Sharkey and proceeded to sink a 25 footer on his way to victory over "Douche of the Day".
    <br>
    <br>
    In the Sandbagger Bob/JB match there was a key moment in the match on the par 3 6th, JB tried to pull a mully but Sandbagger Bob deftly played "The Seth Braverman Rule (no mullys on par 3s)", JB subsequently melted down on the hole cursing both Sandbagger Bob and Seth despite Seth not even being present. Thanks Seth!
    <br>
    <br>
    The Lemonator was reported to be on fire on the front from 150 yards and in on his way to a win vs. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ayles claimed someone stole his ball on the par 3 17th? (Seems an odd hole for that as its not long enough to even lose sight of your ball.)
    <br>
    <br>
    The foursome of JB/Fitzy/Deano/Bob collectively confused the crowd on the par 3 11th as they played the 11th as if the objective was to put the ball in one of the two ponds rather than in the hole on the green. JB -3 balls, Bob -2, Deano -2, Fitzy -1.
    <br>
    <br>
    JB patiently answered the 500 questions that Fitzy asked him before and after every one of his shots.

    6/17/2023 - A Fenny, Shenny, Sometimes Rainy Weekend
    <br>
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br>
    <br> 
    <br>
    The weather today scattered the Sandbagger participants far and wide, some back to bed and the comfort of their wool pajamas, while others stoutheartedly headed out into whatever Mother Nature had to offer. Sandbagger Bob, Joey 3 Wood, and Gentleman Mike hit Royal for dawn patrol duties and found the weatherman mostly wrong about his forecast, at least until they were sitting comfortably at Par4, at which point many a miserable and wet golfer was seen scampering from course back to car. Even Williardy Coyote (not to be confused with his brother Wily) was seen sunning himself near a sandtrap on 16 enjoying the fine morning. With regard to the golf, 3Wood, coming off a painful loss to the Lemonator last week, simultaneously took on Gentleman and Sandbagger and proved too much for both while on his way to shooting a season low 84. Sandbagger Bob was out early while Gentleman Mike took 3Wood to the ninth, but 3Wood's par proved too much. On the back it was a solo match between Gentleman and Sandbagger that seesawed back and forth (hmm redundant?) and ended in a tie. Meanwhile elsewhere some of the pajama crowd regrouped and headed out to Fenwick:  Mikey, JB, Jets Fan, and a player to be nicknamed later (Parker). Mikey and JB battled to a tie while JB litigated for another half-stroke and a win but was denied in all courts in which he filed. Jets Fan attempted to pad his tourney points total by submitting a tie against a non-sanctioned player but the audit committee was quick to disqualify that result and issue a stern warning to Jets Fan that any further shenanigans could cost him his Sandbagger card.

    Lost glasses, lost phone, lost cart key, out of stock hot dogs at turn, late arrival, and the inability of 9 grown men to calculate a tab. Then there was golf. 9 matches on this Saturday with some solid 2 win performances by JB and sandbagger Bob. BTW, 40 on back nine from the Sandbagger to take down SB. Seth shoots 76 and did not win both matches. Brian is on board with first win accelerated by a chip in birdie on 10. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, is still at the Quarry bar complaining that he thinks he tied JB, not true- Joey 3 wood helped his lawyer friend get to the truth. Ken and Mike A picked up a win, Fitz. Joe, and Steve just enjoyed the day. â€Š"

    There was little action in the Sandbaggers' Invitational this weekend, with only Marsha, Marsha, Marsha trying to steamroll Sandbagger Bob. It wasn't to be though.  The two headed into the final hole on the front side of the most royal Shenny tied, where Marsha, Marsha, Marsha requiring too much attention as usual hit the ball time after time finishing with a double bogey 5 and could be heard muttering negatively about Cindy and Jan as he left the green in addition to something about Sandbagger Bob being a total asshole (or was that Kenny from the 10th tee box?). Anyway Sandbagger Bob prevailed with a bogey 4 for the win which freed him to further sandbag his handicap on the back finishing with a 3rd consecutive score in triple digits.
