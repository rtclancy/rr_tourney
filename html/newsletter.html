    There was little action in the Sandbaggers' Invitational this weekend, with only Marsha, Marsha, Marsha trying to steamroll Sandbagger Bob. It wasn't to be though.  The two headed into the final hole on the front side of the most royal Shenny tied, where Marsha, Marsha, Marsha requiring too much attention as usual hit the ball time after time finishing with a double bogey 5 and could be heard muttering negatively about Cindy and Jan as he left the green in addition to something about Sandbagger Bob being a total asshole (or was that Kenny from the 10th tee box?). Anyway Sandbagger Bob prevailed with a bogey 4 for the win which freed him to further sandbag his handicap on the back finishing with a 3rd consecutive score in triple digits.
