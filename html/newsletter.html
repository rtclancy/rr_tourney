    6/17/2023 - A Fenny, Shenny, Sometimes Rainy Weekend
    <br> 
    <br>
    The weather today scattered the Sandbagger participants far and wide, some back to bed and the comfort of their wool pajamas, while others stoutheartedly headed out into whatever Mother Nature had to offer. Sandbagger Bob, Joey 3 Wood, and Gentleman Mike hit Royal for dawn patrol duties and found the weatherman mostly wrong about his forecast, at least until they were sitting comfortably at Par4, at which point many a miserable and wet golfer was seen scampering from course back to car. Even Williardy Coyote (not to be confused with his brother Wily) was seen sunning himself near a sandtrap on 16 enjoying the fine morning. With regard to the golf, 3Wood, coming off a painful loss to the Lemonator last week, simultaneously took on Gentleman and Sandbagger and proved too much for both while on his way to shooting a season low 84. Sandbagger Bob was out early while Gentleman Mike took 3Wood to the ninth, but 3Wood's par proved too much. On the back it was a solo match between Gentleman and Sandbagger that seesawed back and forth (hmm redundant?) and ended in a tie. Meanwhile elsewhere some of the pajama crowd regrouped and headed out to Fenwick:  Mikey, JB, Jets Fan, and a player to be nicknamed later (Parker). Mikey and JB battled to a tie while JB litigated for another half-stroke and a win but was denied in all courts in which he filed. Jets Fan attempted to pad his tourney points total by submitting a tie against a non-sanctioned player but the audit committee was quick to disqualify that result and issue a stern warning to Jets Fan that any further shenanigans could cost him his Sandbagger card.

    6/10/2023 - Quarry Ridge, Contributor at Large Joey 3 Wood
    <BR>
    <br>
    Lost glasses, lost phone, lost cart key, out of stock hot dogs at turn, late arrival, and the inability of 9 grown men to calculate a tab. Then there was golf. 9 matches on this Saturday with some solid 2 win performances by JB and sandbagger Bob. BTW, 40 on back nine from the Sandbagger to take down SB. Seth shoots 76 and did not win both matches. Brian is on board with first win accelerated by a chip in birdie on 10. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, is still at the Quarry bar complaining that he thinks he tied JB, not true- Joey 3 wood helped his lawyer friend get to the truth. Ken and Mike A picked up a win, Fitz. Joe, and Steve just enjoyed the day. â€Š"

    There was little action in the Sandbaggers' Invitational this weekend, with only Marsha, Marsha, Marsha trying to steamroll Sandbagger Bob. It wasn't to be though.  The two headed into the final hole on the front side of the most royal Shenny tied, where Marsha, Marsha, Marsha requiring too much attention as usual hit the ball time after time finishing with a double bogey 5 and could be heard muttering negatively about Cindy and Jan as he left the green in addition to something about Sandbagger Bob being a total asshole (or was that Kenny from the 10th tee box?). Anyway Sandbagger Bob prevailed with a bogey 4 for the win which freed him to further sandbag his handicap on the back finishing with a 3rd consecutive score in triple digits.
